            <h1 style="color: rgb(122, 92, 129)"> The End of the game? </h1>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;"> The End is one of Minecraft's 3 dimensions. This dimension is often considrered as the final one in the game since this is where the Ender Dragon fight takes place. Unlike the other 2 dimensions, the End is an almost lifeless and empty place filled with end islands surrounded by the dark void. Unlike the Nether, this dimension doesn't have any fog for its atmosphere. This dimension has the least amount of biomes and structures out of the 3 dimensions in the game. Your main goal here is to defeat the final boss of Minecraft, the Ender Dragon. </p>
            <p> An image of the End Dimension, featuring the main End Island in the middle and the outer end islands: </p>

             <img src="../assets/EnderDragon.gif" style = "text-align: center; width: 280px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-top: 30px;"> 
             <p> Similarly to the nether, you will need a portal to enter this dimension. Unlike the Nether portal however, the End portal cannot be built. Instead, you need to find an end portal inside a stronghold and activate it using eye-of-enders. </p>
             <p> 2 images of an end portal (left: inactive, right: active): </p>

            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The End City </h2>
             <p> Unlike this other 2 dimensions, the End only has 1 structure. The End's only structure is the End City. End cities can naturally spawn in the large outer end islands. End cities are tall purple buildings composed of End stone bricks, purpur blocks and end rods for light. End cities may generate as either a single building or a group of connected buildings. The main inhabitants of end cities are shulkers, which are hostile mobs that levitate you when you get hit by their attack. These shulkers guard the loot in these buildings. The loot here is usually high-quality armor/weapons meant for end-game purposes. </p>

            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The End Ship </h2>
            <p> The End Ship is a floating structure which can sometimes be found beside end cities. The ship is made of purpur blocks and endstone bricks, just like the end cities. The end ship contains loot that's more valuable compared to the loot in the end city. Inside the ship contains a treasure room. The treasure room contains 2 chests and an guaranteed elytra in the middle. The end ship is the only structure in the game where you can obtain an elytra. </p>

            <h1 style="color: rgb(122, 92, 129)"> The Biomes </h1>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;"> Unlike the other 2 dimensions, the biomes in the End don't differ much from each other in terms of appearance, mobs and terrain. </p>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The Main End Island </h2>
            <p> The main end island is the first area you'll spawn in once you enter the end portal. This is the island where you fight the ender dragon. The island is made up of end stone and obsidian pillars which contain end crystals. The inhabitants of this island are endermen and of course, the ender dragon. After defeating the ender dragon, end gateways will oepn up, which will allow you to teleport to the outer end islands. Also, once the ender-dragon is defeated, a huge portal made up of bedrock in the middle of the island will oepn up. This portal will let you teleport back to the overworld.  </p>
            <p> An image of the main end island: </p>
            <img src="../assets/MainEnd.png" style = "text-align: center; width: 420px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-top: 30px;">
            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The Small End Islands </h2>
            <p> This biome generates as part of the outer islands of the End. These are tiny circular islands made up of end stone. Endermen inhabit this biome. </p>
            <p> An image of the small end islands: </p>
            <img src="../assets/SmallEndIslands.png" style = "text-align: center; width: 420px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-top: 30px;">
            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The End Midlands </h2>
            <p> This biome generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the gradual slope from the hilltops of each island down to the cliffs around the edge. The inhabitans of this biome are endermen. End cities have a chance of spawning in this biome too.  </p>
            <p> An image of the end midlands along with an end gateway: </p>
            <img src="../assets/EndMidlands.png" style = "text-align: center; width: 420px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-top: 30px;">
            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The End Highlands </h2>
            <p> This biome generates as part of the outer islands of the End. Thus biome represents the hilltops of the outer end islands. End cities and large amounts of chorus trees spawn in this biome. The inhabitants of this biome are endermen. </p>

            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The End Barrens </h2>
            <p> This biome generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This is a tiny biome that represents the outer rims of each end island. Chorus trees and end cities cannot generate naturally in this biome. Just like any other end biome, the inhabitants of this biome are endermen. </p>
            <p> An image of the End Barrens: </p>
            <img src="../assets/EndBarrens.png" style = "text-align: center; width: 420px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-top: 30px;">

        <div class="big-box4">

            <h1 style="color: rgb(122, 92, 129)"> A quick progression guide </h1>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> Finding a stronghold </h2>
            <p> In order to find a stronghold, you must gather tons of ender pearls and blaze power. Then, craft multiple Eyes of Ender using those ender pearls and blaze power. Throw an eye of ender in the sky. Once thrown, the eye of ender will automatically float towards the nearest stronghold. Keep doing this until the eye of ender goes straight down. This means that you're on top of a stronghold. Start digging down carefully until you've reached the stronghold. Once here, traverse through the structure until you find the end portal. </p>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> Before entering the portal </h2>
            <p> Make sure that you already have enchanted armor and weapons (diamond or netherite) and tons of food since you're gonna be healing a lot when fighting the ender dragon. Bring a bow so you can easily hit the end crystals on top of the obsidian pillars. Bring a water bucket since you can use this to climb up and safely get down the obsidian pillars. It's recommended to set up a spawnpoint near the portal with a bed before entering the end portal. Finally, once you're ready, activate the end portal by placing the eye of enders in the end portal frames. </p>
            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The Ender Dragon Fight </h2> 
            <p> First of all, your first priority is to destroy the end crystals on top of the obsidian pillars. You can do this by either manually climbing up each pillar with your water bucket or with some spare blocks or you can use your bow and carefully aim at the crystals. Once all crystals have been destroyed, you can now attack the dragon without it healing. Whenever the dragon goes downward to the bedrock portal in the middle, attack it with your sword. When the dragon is in the air, you can use your bow to damage it. Avoid its attacks by constantly moving and healing once you get damaged. There's also a chance that you enrage an enderman. When this happens, stay calm and place water around you since an enderman's weakness is water. Keep repeating this process until you eventually kill the ender dragon. Once you kill the ender dragon, the bedrock portal in the middle of the main end island will open up. End gateways around the main end island will also open up. When entering the bedrock portal, the game's credits will play and you will get teleported back to the overworld. When entering the end gateways, you will be transported to the outer end islands. </p> 
            <h2 style="color: rgb(105, 79, 111)"> The Outer End Islands </h2>
            <p> When you enter an end gateway, you will be transported to the outer end islands. Search for an end city by exploring these islands. When you find once, your first goal is to check if there's an end ship. If there's an end ship, carefully go towards it. Once you're in the ship, find the treasure room and kill the shulker guarding it. After that, loot the ship and get the elytra. You can also loot the end cities by carefully killing the shulkers guarding the buildings. </p>
