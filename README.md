 Note: We will be using JS for things like hovering effects and for the quiz page, a lot of it will use JS to function. For example, in the quiz, we will be using JS to check if this answer is the correct one or not. Another example is incorporating a score system with the help of JS.

# Q3 Updated Proposal

## Design and narrative on the HTML form and webpages:

 For our updated website, we have decided to include 3 new webpages. The most important webpage here is the sign-up page. This webpage allows the user to create a profile by asking for various information with the use of dropdown boxes and check boxes. The information asked from the user are their username, password and other interesting Minecraft facts about them (such as favorite biome, playstyle, etc.). After the user fills in the required data in the sign-up page, the data will get saved on the user's computer using local storage. The main purpose of the HTML form in our website is to store content from the user and display it on other webpages on our website.

 The data obtained from the sign-up page will be used in our other new webpages, which are the login and player profile pages.

 In the login page, the user is able to login to their account by inputting the password and username which were saved in the sign-up page. The user will be able to access the player profile page ONLY if they have successfully logged in. 

 The profile page is divided into 2 sections. The first one shows the user's username and profile picture. The other section shows the user the data which about the other interesting Minecraft facts about them they've inputted in the sign-up page such as their favorite dimension, skills and more.

 Note: The player can actually choose their profile picture in the profile page, not in the sign-up page.
